Now what do you think would the salary of employee1 be? As we have increased the salary of cloned employee, 
we naturally expect the salary to be increased for him. But the unexpected turn here is the salary for employee1 
also gets increased. Here is the output or this:


Employee{name:=Ram, id:=1, package:=750000.0}
Employee{name:=Krish, id:=2, package:=750000.0}

Please note that when we clone an object, the constructor does not get called. It would rather make a field-by-field 
copy of all the member variables present in the address location of the original object. And now when there are 
object references, the reference gets copied but not the original object. Hence both the original and cloned objects 
point to the same member object. So changes made in one object would automatically be visible to the other.
