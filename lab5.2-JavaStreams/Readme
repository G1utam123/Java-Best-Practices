Instead of writing a complicated code for Java loops within/after loops, the coder 
could simply write a pipeline in a few lines and the intent of it would be clear 
at a glance (in most cases). It resulted in a cleaner code and 
reduced the need for comments (a huge upside for me personally).

Code writing became faster. Code writing became easier. Knowing how to use 
Java streams was one of the most important conditions to be accepted in most 
companies as a Java developer.
